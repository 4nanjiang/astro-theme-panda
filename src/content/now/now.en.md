## The Direction of My Life Story

Imagining life as a game, where am I in the story right now?

### üè∞‚öîÔ∏è Main Quest: Finding a Job, Moving to Another City

*Due to financial constraints, I feel restricted and seek more freedom.*

I'm exploring ways to generate income through different channels.
- I'm looking for a job. Firstly, it would allow me to start fresh in a new city; secondly, I'm exploring fields that could generate value in the future; and thirdly, I want to try different things.
- I've started exploring social media and e-commerce.

### üó∫Ô∏èüîç Side Quest Adventures

#### Protagonist's Self-Awareness

*Currently, I struggle with laziness and procrastination, lacking mindfulness and responsibility. Believing in long-term thinking, I hope to gain compound benefits each day.*

I'm trying to develop thinking habits through consistent routines. Currently, I maintain morning pages, daily planning, blog writing, and expense tracking, using Habitica to monitor these habits.

I also want to experience better health, so I've started maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying to avoid sitting for long periods.

#### Unveiling World's Mysteries: Exploration

*I've isolated myself for a long time, both geographically and spiritually. I'm telling myself not to be shy, to actively engage, and to keep making choices.*

I'm trying to read extensively, starting with fiction. Currently reading "The Book of Illusions" and "The Story of America" before bed.

I like a book title called "Die If You Don't Go." I plan to visit Hong Kong this year to experience different cultures. I want to explore more places and am learning English vocabulary using Anki.

I frequently watch movies, TV series, and anime. Just finished "The Substance", currently watching "Sh≈çgun" and "Solo Leveling." However, I realized one day that without reflection, sharing, and creation, it's merely consumption - not genuine interest or passion. Going forward, I'll share my thoughts when I find media I enjoy.

#### Meeting People

I care about my family and friends but rarely take action. I have few friends and wish to meet interesting people.
