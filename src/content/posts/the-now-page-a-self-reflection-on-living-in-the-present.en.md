I've added a [NOW](https://nownownow.com/about) page to my blog, a space dedicated to the present moment.

The purpose isn't to announce "what I'm currently busy with." I believe that no one is interested in a stranger's (my) current life, just as no one wants to read a blog from an unknown person.

Adding a NOW page is an exercise in self-dialogue. I'm trying to rationally ask myself: how do I want to live in the present, what do I want to focus my energy on, and where do I want to invest my time? This is an experiment in **living in the present**.

Recently, I gamified my task management APP, imagining myself as a hero in a game. I compared life to a game story, and as the hero, I established two modules: main quests and side adventures. Similarly, creating a NOW page on my blog serves as a public declaration. From a broader perspective, it helps me consider the main and side storylines of life while guiding the direction of this (game) story.

What is a Now page? In this game called life, it's where I attempt to control and choose the direction of my story in the present moment. As the protagonist, I need to contemplate: where am I now, where do I want to go, and how do I get there?
