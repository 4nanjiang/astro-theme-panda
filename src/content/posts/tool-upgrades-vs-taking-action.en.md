Recently, I've been overly focused on AI-related news, deluding myself into thinking I'm engaging with cutting-edge fields. However, none of these numerous tools actually contribute to my current production or creation.

Naturally, upgrading productivity tools is necessary. But in most cases, efficiency and results aren't tool-driven. Some people can manage effectively with just a notebook, and decades ago, people became wise through simple reading and thinking. The fantasy about new tools and efficiency becomes a self-imposed barrier and prerequisite.

Yesterday, I looked at new smart bands, with the Xiaomi Band 9 Pro being a worthy purchase option. I also researched e-readers; for 7-inch devices, content creators recommend the PocketBook Ocean, comparing closed versus open systems, with Boox Leaf3 as another option. But here's the thing: will buying a smart band make me start exercising? Conversely, I could start exercising even without one. My current Kindle still works fine, so why do I keep wanting a new one? It's just an excuse for not reading.

My time perception is a mess. I'm thinking about using time-tracking tools again to see where my day goes. However, I clearly understand that such tools are meant for efficient analysis and building awareness. Yet, I'm far from needing to optimize time usage efficiently. I don't need reminders to build awareness - I already know what I should and shouldn't do.
