Sudden melancholy and emptiness. With every breath, I feel the heat of the air I exhale. It’s as if something inside me has nowhere to settle, nowhere to be released. My body feels suspended, drifting along with a helpless, wandering soul.

I am lost. Unaware of time, unconscious of place. Stagnant, as if my body is decaying underground; dazed, as if my soul is rootless, drifting in a pale void.

The meaning of life, the meaning of the future, feels so insignificant as to be ignored.

I lie here, my organs breathing.
