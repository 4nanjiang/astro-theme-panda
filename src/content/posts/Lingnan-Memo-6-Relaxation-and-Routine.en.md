The newly arrived nail clipper broke at the handle on the first attempt with my big toe. Recently, buying daily necessities online has not brought much joy when unboxing.

Having lunch with a new colleague was actually an opportunity to get to know each other. Daily complaints are part of the job, as is the platform’s poor condition. The difference is, for him, this job is more like a part-time gig.

After lunch, I found it was raining outside. I went back to buy an umbrella and stepped into the rain, feeling like I had entered a steam room. My glasses quickly fogged up, and my skin was steamed and roasted.

Today, after finishing some tedious tasks, I might finally start working on something I’m truly interested in.

What amazes me most at work is the use of AI. Without being familiar with the product or business, everything relies on AI to generate product information and content. There’s no attempt to build a basic framework first, just a hope that quantitative execution will lead to qualitative change.

Life has shifted, making me a bit more relaxed after coming home recently. When I oversleep, I sometimes feel a bit anxious and guilty. Today, I tried to organize a new daily routine and find some time for self-learning.

At my residence, garbage must be disposed of at set times. Every night when I return home, I have to make time to go downstairs again to throw away takeout packaging and other trash.

These days, when I get home, I half-watch and half-listen to live streams of Hunter x Hunter.

Also, while watching episode six of Lord of the Mysteries, I felt somewhat confused for no apparent reason.
