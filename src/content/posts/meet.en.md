A game called "Eastern: Wild Goose on the Plain" was released today. While I'm not interested in the game itself, it reminded me of a short film titled "Encounter" that the production team released in November 2022.

The short film, running for 8 minutes, has nothing to do with the game. Perhaps due to the lingering effects of the pandemic, or my own sense of solitude, I unexpectedly found myself moved to tears while watching it. This emotional response was similar to what I experienced when watching "Life in a Day."
