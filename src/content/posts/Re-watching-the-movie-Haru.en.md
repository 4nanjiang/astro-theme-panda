I rarely re-watch novels or movies. Whether it's because I'm chasing too many new experiences or afraid of diluting old memories, I'm not quite sure.

Some days ago, I accidentally heard the soundtrack from "Haru" online and found the scene where Hoshino and Haru gaze at each other from the Shinkansen. The romance touched me once again. During the Spring Festival, I decided to re-watch "Haru."

While watching, I realized how many details my memory had lost. I only remembered the subtle feelings between them but had forgotten their independent lives. While Hoshino was trapped in his past and Haru was starting anew, the internet merely served as an accidentally opened window, connecting them with a single thread.

Between the two storylines, the director clearly favored the female protagonist, with Eri Fukatsu bringing more nuance to her character. The male lead's unfamiliarity with the internet served to illustrate the era's emerging online relationships. The story's pace, like Mao Buyi's "Slow as Before," unfolds gradually.

Re-watching the film, I experienced both the beauty in my memories and the complete, yet sometimes disjointed narrative. What I remembered as a perfect ending was actually just their beginning, with their paths only starting to intersect in the real world.

While I was immersed in the film's romance, delighting in love's blossoming, I had forgotten Rose's words: "Sister would be your type." Perhaps the story is just beginning, and their future remains particularly uncertain.
