"A rare weekend." This thought popped into my mind in the morning.

After a week of new routines, I still feel somewhat lost. Both my body and mind are doubly fatigued.
Arriving home after six, I clutch my phone, unwilling to think or imagine proactively, becoming drowsy. Sometimes, I forget about dinner, letting a few hours slip by in a haze, only ordering takeout close to 8 PM. After dawdling for a while, I finish washing up by half past nine. The evening seems long, yet it’s already past ten. Sleepiness always easily overcomes my willpower.

In the coming week, I should adjust my pace and plan my daily routine well. At the same time, I need to strengthen my physical training. Otherwise, my energy will be depleted sooner or later.

Today, I suddenly thought of "Tokyo Eight Square Meters." In a cramped living space, one supplements life through public spaces outside. So, I simply decided to visit a nearby mall and buy a few clothes.

After having noodles at the mall, I spent a long time at the bookstore on the third floor. At the entrance were "Shi Nan Zhi Tu" and Nezha, and further in were the best-selling books. Inside, there was a café, and then the classification of the sea of books.
Mystery, science fiction, history, social science, literature—I picked up every book I’ve read or listened to, feeling the weight that e-books lack.

Japanese literature clearly has a bigger market than European or Latin American works, with its own dedicated shelves. A collection of Wang Xiaobo’s works was placed next to Sanmao’s travel notes, while "Red Whisk Woman" and "River Town" were on another shelf. Next to Harry Potter were mystery and science fiction books, and below "Foundation" and "Galactic Empire," I found "Aesbi’s Dream." "Jiangcun Literature" and "Rural China" were in the social science section, while "Being in the Situation" was in the business section. "The Hungry Prosperous Era" was next to the "Half-Hour manga History" series. I saw the 14th edition of "Understanding Movies," and on the same shelf was Hirokazu Kore-eda’s autobiography. The biography of Elon Musk was in the business section, Fei-Fei Li’s autobiography was in the popular science section, and nearby were several books on feminism. The Nobel Prize had its own shelf, next to the classics. Finally, between the "Chainsaw Man" and "Skip and Loafer" comics, I saw "Araki Hirohiko’s Manga Technique."
