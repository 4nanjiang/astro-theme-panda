- Why do Chinese internet companies always launch separate apps for international markets? For Xiaohongshu, the influx of foreign users might be more harmful than beneficial.

- Why aren't users migrating to Douyin? Because Douyin requires a Chinese phone number.

- For American "refugees," flooding into Xiaohongshu isn't about consuming contentâ€”it's an act of defiance against authority. Their reasoning seems to be: if the government fears Chinese TikTok, they'll migrate to another Chinese app.

- They love TikTok, they didn't choose X or Meta, they're Generation Z.

- They care about both privacy and freedom of choice.

- In the Xiaohongshu subreddit, many posts report users being banned.

- Foreign-created posts have started appearing in my Xiaohongshu feed. It's interesting how Xiaohongshu's recommendation algorithm can surface these posts from zero-following accounts.
