The Lord of the Mysteries animation adaptation has been released.
Previously, they released several technically impressive PVs, reminiscent of the ill-fated Dragon Raja animation. The final PV raised my expectations, which led to my mixed feelings after watching the actual series.
In terms of visuals and storyboarding, effort was clearly invested; however, the beautiful backgrounds feel like green screens, never quite integrating with the characters. While the fast-paced narrative is an inevitable result of web novel adaptation, the loss of world-building and character details diminishes our empathy for both the world's circumstances and the characters' transformations. Without proper emotional resonance, the characters become bland. Characters in a story need details to match their archetypal impressions for successful character building.
Is Lord of the Mysteries similar to To Be Hero X - beautiful and stylish, with its only flaw being that it's somewhat unappealing?

I listened to the new episode of "I Am a Singer" and found some of the song adaptations unacceptable. At this point, it can no longer serve as a repository for discovering new songs, as they only perform popular hits. On a side note, I heard this year's Golden Melody Awards were also disappointing.

The domestic OWCS competition has concluded. The streaming and forum environment proved more disappointing than the competition itself. NGA remains a cesspool; stream-hopping is the mainstream trend, while quietly watching streams is labeled as "brown-nosing"; streamers and commentators tend to deliberately "create drama" to influence others, with "drama equals traffic" becoming the content creation motto; the antonym of righteous indignation has become conformity.
I saw a statistic showing that Arab countries have the highest influx of millionaires, due to zero personal income tax and capital gains tax.

Vedal released a turtle plushie priced at $29.90. Considering domestic production costs, it probably costs just a few RMB to make. The layered pricing of a product and the consideration of cost proportions make for an interesting analysis.

For storing blog images, I configured Cloudflare as an image host. PICGO configuration failed; looking at others' feedback in the issues, it seems to be a version compatibility problem. Eventually, I used a tool within Utools.

Today, I continued reading "1587, A Year of No Significance." After understanding Hai Rui's administrative and law enforcement principles, I finally realized what it means to govern based on ethics and morality. Administration isn't about solving problems, but about restoring human affairs to their proper order under ethical and moral guidance.

I came across a quote that goes something like: Understanding the world relies not on cognition, but on experience.
