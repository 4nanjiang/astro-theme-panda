I fear being asked about my interests or hobbies.

In childhood, I could answer easily, but as I've grown older, I've gradually lost the ability to respond. I've become cautious, constantly pondering: Do I really like this? Am I truly investing my heart in it, or am I merely filling an empty void?

As self-questioning increased, I began to doubt whether I truly understand what it means to "like" something, or if I know how to like. "You either like something or you don't"—is it really that simple? Over time, I found myself seemingly lacking passion for anything. So I questioned myself again: Is "liking" a form of passion?

Recently, I've come to realize that liking is intimately connected with the consumption and production of content and value.

- The degree of liking is proportional to both the cost of acquiring content/value and the potential loss of value.
  
- Liking can be divided into three stages: consumption, associative creation, and value production.
  
- Liking isn't merely passion—it requires continuous investment and creates value that benefits others.
  
- Liking always drives sharing, making it inherently an altruistic behavior.
