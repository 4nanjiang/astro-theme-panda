I came across several new PKM note-taking tools on Hacker News, among which was [Trilium](https://trilium.smj.im).

It stores data using an SQL database approach and features a classic UI interface. Some users have migrated from Logseq, likely because it also breaks free from the constraints of folders. Notes can establish parent-child relationships, similar to the "book/book name" structure in Logseq. The tree-structured note organization gives Trilium an inherent sense of "organization" from the start, positioning it between Logseq's scattered approach and Obsidian's rigid structure.

Tools like Trilium add attributes to markdown to achieve more diverse and extended functionality. I suddenly understand why Logseq is developing a database version.
