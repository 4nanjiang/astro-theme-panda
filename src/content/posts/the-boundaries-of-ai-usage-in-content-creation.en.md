description: 'A reflection on the boundaries between AI and human creation, questioning the significance of emphasizing the distinction between AI and human content while highlighting the value of the creative process and the essence of tool usage.'

Recently, I came across a blog where the author declared in the footer that the content was written by a human, not generated by AI. This can be seen as a statement of content value, resisting low-quality AI content farms; it can also be interpreted as an individual's declaration of self-existence, emphasizing that the content comes from a living being with both rationality and sensibility.

This appears to be an attempt to establish boundaries, drawing a line between different entities. However, this distinction is merely an imagined concept, where an individual tries to shape two abstract groups and attempts to represent the human collective. For readers, whether content originates from AI is not important; what matters is whether they can obtain appropriate content value or emotional resonance. For authors, content creation only involves an individual's exploration of existence and value, which never stems from external differentiation and isolation.

Writing or creation is not about the result, but the process. When creative output is compared with AI, the focus shouldn't be on the boundaries of AI usage, but on refining our understanding of the experiences and insights gained during the creative process.

Contemplating the boundaries of tools is meaningless. The significance of tools lies in how we use them and how we create with them.
