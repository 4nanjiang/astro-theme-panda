# Books

Having read 20 books in 2022, I set my Goodreads reading challenge to 21 at the beginning of 2023, thinking the new year should bring progress. Eventually, I read 28 books in 2023, with 340 hours recorded on WeRead.

While it appears to average nearly an hour of reading daily, the actual reading experience was quite different. I only maintained consistent reading habits for seven months (January, May, June, July, August, September, and December). There was no regular reading time each day; although I planned to develop a habit of reading after lunch and before bed, it never stuck. The 340 hours actually consisted of: listening to audiobooks while cooking, using audiobooks to fall asleep, and reading numerous mystery novels and web novels.

## Reading Journey

### January

I developed an interest in reading classics, and though I didn't fully act on it, similar thoughts emerged throughout the year. I searched for reading lists, looked up recommendations from literary figures, and kept Maugham's "Books and You" at the top of my bookshelf. In January, I wanted to start simple, so "The Count of Monte Cristo" became my companion throughout the month. Setting aside the reading experience and impressions, this marked the beginning of my serious reading journey.

Throughout the year, I primarily used WeRead for reading, incorporating some utilitarian approaches. Some months, I participated in WeRead's 30-day reading challenges to force myself to read, though this often resulted in binge-reading mystery novels before deadlines. Looking back now, the outcome wasn't bad.

That month, I also read "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry," and surprisingly, my critical tweet about it was retweeted by an aerospace student.

### February

I attempted to read "Economics of a Small Island," "Principles," and "Economic Thinking," though all were left unfinished. I wanted to study economics, just as I wanted to read political philosophy.

### March

This was a month of web novel addiction. I estimate I spent hundreds of hours reading "Chixin Xuntian." In subsequent months, I also spent long periods immersed in web novels like "Throne of Magical Arcana" and "Qin Li." Like my experience with Chinese and Korean comics this year, despite knowing it was time-consuming, I still fell into this mental time sink.

### April

I read an English business writing book called "Smart Brevity," using an immersive translation plugin with Google Translate for bilingual reading. While I didn't use AI translation, I did read several other machine-translated English books this year.

I stopped viewing reading as a serious, formal activity. As Maugham said, reading is for pleasure, and I believe this applies to both spiritual and intellectual enjoyment. Consequently, I have many unfinished books, some abandoned halfway. I've learned that reading should be a natural, flexible pursuit.

### May - September

I spent most of this time immersed in Japanese science fiction and mystery novels. The sci-fi novel "Dreams of the Abyss" touched me deeply with its gentle portrayal of tolerance, undoubtedly becoming my book of the year. "Human Extinction" and "Klein's Flask," blending sci-fi and mystery, featured intricate plot designs and fascinating storylines. "Golden Slumber" was a tale of human innocence and fairy tales. The elderly lady in "The Great Kidnapping" left an unforgettable impression. "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "99% Kidnapping" didn't leave much of an impression.

Reading "Days at Morisaki Bookstore" in May deepened my commitment to Japanese literature, with its small stories of life reflecting larger truths. This became one catalyst for my focus on Japanese novels during this period.

Beyond fiction, I read several social science books:

- "Fish, Fins, and Sichuan Pepper" - a foreigner's perspective on Chengdu, China
- "You'll Die If You Don't Travel" - a global cycling journey that sparked my wanderlust
- "The Art of Not Reading News" - advocating news abstinence before social media's rise
- "Man's Search for Meaning" - teaching that humans always have freedom of choice, even facing death
- "The 4-Hour Work Week" - discussing new middle-class wealth and lifestyle strategies
- "Hello, I am Feynman" - a tedious pseudo-autobiography
- "Building a Second Brain" - CODE and PARA methodologies, proving theory through practice
- "YouTube Secrets" - beginner YouTuber guide

Two lifestyle books deserve special mention: "Walden" and "Tokyo in 8 Square Meters." The first chronicles Thoreau's solitary life at Walden Pond, while the second describes living in a tiny Tokyo apartment. One in wilderness, one in city, both pursuing independence and freedom. I particularly loved their opening chapters on "Economy" - Thoreau meticulously recording his income and expenses at Walden Pond, and the author describing how to achieve economic and lifestyle self-sufficiency in an 8-square-meter room, effectively expanding it to encompass all of Tokyo.

### October - December

I learned photography basics from "New Photography Notes." "Mindfulness in Plain English" taught me to reassess the value of personal experience and distinguish between external impositions and genuine self-possession. Only through personal experience can one find truth.

Reading "Born a Crime" resonated with my experiences of poverty and touched on themes of diverse discrimination and coexistence.

I don't think I fully understood "Flowers for Algernon."

## Reading Reflections

2023 was meant to be a year of increasing reading volume. Looking back at the books I've read, I'm grateful for the emotions and joy experienced in the moment. I read some books and abandoned others. While I regret not organizing and reviewing my reading notes and highlights, this was just the first step. I look forward to developing better habits and reading more deeply in 2024.

# Comics

When Japanese manga began to feel stale, I explored Korean manhwa this year, including excellent works like "Return of the Mount Hua Sect," "Northern Blade," and "Moving." It's remarkable how Korean manhwa has carved its own path in martial arts character and story development.

Despite losing interest in new anime seasons, I still watched many animations, including Chinese ones. My favorite was "Uncle from Another World."

# Content Creators

## Streamers

Twitch's 2023 personal recap surprised me with over 300 hours of watch time. Adding Douyu and Bilibili viewing time would likely double that figure. Comparing the time spent watching streams to reading books makes me feel ashamed and regretful. Looking back at my 2023 streaming experience, the highlights were gradually getting into Twitch and continuing to follow VTubers.

For personal recommendations of the year: on Twitch, I recommend CookSux, who stays young at heart at 40 and doesn't care about external opinions. For VTubers, I recommend Shizuru Ruru, a virtual streamer with incredible drive.
