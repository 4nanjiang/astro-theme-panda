Looking back at 2023, my media consumption patterns have evolved significantly. Here's a comprehensive review of my year in books and various media forms.

## Reading Statistics

According to WeChat Reading, I spent approximately 200 hours reading in 2023, averaging 33 minutes per day. While this falls short of my Goodreads challenge goal, it represents a consistent reading habit.

## Notable Books

Some of the most impactful books I read this year include:
- "The Psychology of Money"
- "Atomic Habits"
- "The Courage to Be Disliked"
- "Project Japan"
- "A Philosophy of Software Design"

Each book contributed uniquely to my understanding of different aspects of life, from personal finance to professional development.

## Media Consumption

Beyond books, my media consumption included:
- Documentaries about architecture and urban development
- Tech-focused podcasts
- Selected anime series
- Various online courses and tutorials

## Reflections

This year's reading and media consumption has been more intentional than random. I've noticed a shift towards more structured learning, though there's still room for improvement in terms of depth and retention.

## Looking Forward

For 2024, I aim to:
- Increase my daily reading average to 45 minutes
- Focus more on long-form content
- Better balance between technical and non-technical reading
- Implement more of what I learn
