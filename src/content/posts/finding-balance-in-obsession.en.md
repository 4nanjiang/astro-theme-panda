These days I've been obsessed with web novels.

When it comes to things I'm obsessed with, I always struggle with moderation. It's not just entertainment - when I was modifying my blog, I became so absorbed that I lost track of lunch, dinner, and even bedtime.

Whether it's obsession with pleasure or work, moderation is essential, and we need to plan their time blocks and schedules.
