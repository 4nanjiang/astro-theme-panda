# 🏃‍♂️ Thinking, Feeling, and Action

These three words are parallel in clear thinking.

I still feel like a parasite. I hope to have my own house and bloom from there, but I haven't taken a single step yet. I haven't engaged in any activities that promote financial, social, or spiritual growth. I understand that experiencing life requires stepping out.

I should create a list for daily contemplation during leisure time, making these issues feel important.

# 👏 The Expected Domino Effect

[Content redacted for privacy]

I've fallen into a world of laziness, doing nothing, browsing social forums daily, watching live streams, and fantasizing about dreams and the future. A life without thought is conscious, it's just a matter of whether one is willing to face it.

Thus, as mentioned above, I'm only planning to plan, dreaming about future dreams.

**I still believe I can take the first step, and I hope that like dominoes, once I take that step, I won't come to a halt.**

I finished reading this book but didn't find it particularly impressive.
