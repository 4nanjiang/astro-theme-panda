Since yesterday, I've been thinking about what tools to use to manage my roadmap and the projects under it. This thought started with the construction of the Habitica routine webpage. I used AI to build the webpage, using unfamiliar tools, and even started to conceptualize the structure and UI of the webpage. It was only yesterday that I realized I was reinventing the wheel instead of using mature products.

### What I want is:

- A process, Kanban board, or whiteboard to draw my roadmap
- The roadmap should display my directions and the personal projects under those directions
- Separate schedule management and task management, tracking both project tasks and temporary tasks
- Tasks need a calendar view; I need to plan task durations and estimate time
- It would be best to have a Pomodoro timer and time tracking to see how much time I spend on projects
- A routine habit tracking tool with a heatmap display
- Daily experience value: A scoring system needs to be set up
- A life journey map, on a weekly basis, counting down the remaining life, recording highlights and important matters
- Paired with the life journey map, a life experience checklist, aiming to live an experiential life at the appropriate age

### Tool Intentions

- Logseq
- Notion
- Obsidian

### Tool Selection Analysis

- Logseq, Notion, etc., can all embed whiteboard tools. However, the system's whiteboard view cannot be embedded in a page, and plugin tools cannot be embedded in a block. So, the current plan is to draw a brief roadmap outline and then list personal projects in a Kanban board.
- Notion has complete task management and project management capabilities, as well as a calendar tool. Logseq requires scheduling and reminders elsewhere, and it's difficult to easily display and manage daily tasks together. Currently using Google Calendar.
- Time tracking: Currently using Toggl Track
- Habit tracking: Currently using Habitica, but it doesn't have a heatmap
- Life journey map: Currently thinking of developing a webpage, but it can actually be set up in Notion

### Overall Consideration
- Logseq is a transit station for trivial matters
- Notion is a product manual that can be displayed and sold
- Future finished project documentation will all be placed in Notion; Logseq is a tool for fragmented thinking
- Fragmented tools: Use memos, just copy
