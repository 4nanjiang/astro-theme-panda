Similar to project planning and execution, the method involves quickly creating a minimum viable model, followed by validation and data evaluation, then repeating this cycle of hypothesis and verification.

In daily planning and execution, when tasks cannot be completed as planned and no rewards from execution are visible, repeating such plans becomes extremely discouraging.

Planning and execution form a closed loop that requires visible outcomes, whether it's a sense of completion or rewards.

Therefore, to promote this loop:
- It's necessary to create small, definitely achievable plans, such as deep breathing exercises, stretching breaks during long sitting periods, and practicing gratitude;
- Rewards are needed, using feedback to drive the cycle;
- Reflect on whether these actions are moving the wheel forward, and consider how to improve.
