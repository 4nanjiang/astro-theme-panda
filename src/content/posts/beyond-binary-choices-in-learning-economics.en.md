Yesterday, I had the idea to formally study microeconomics. I thought about finding textbooks from prestigious universities or following online courses with a regular weekly schedule.

On the same day, I came across a Reddit post suggesting that rather than taking online courses, one should directly enter the business market and learn economics through actual trading. As Thoreau roughly said, the best place to learn economics is at the seaside docks.

I often find myself caught in such dilemmas, leading to indecision. However, this isn't really a multiple-choice question - I can choose either path, or even pursue both simultaneously. Whichever choice I make, I'm moving forward, and these paths might intersect somewhere along the way.
