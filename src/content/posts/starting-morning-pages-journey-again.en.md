Once again, I've made a firm decision to start writing [morning pages](https://www.vox.com/life/393304/journaling-how-to-artists-way-shadow-work-mental-health-habit-goals).

Previously, I maintained a structured nine-grid morning journal for a while, and then practiced unrestricted morning pages for some time. This time, I plan to continue with the unrestricted format while adding tracking of short-term goals and reflection on long-term values.

I believe habits shape who we are. Morning pages mark the beginning of each day, and I hope they can help me live more fully in the present.
