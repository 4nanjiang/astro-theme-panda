## Background

Design a small ritual and process for task initiation to avoid distraction and procrastination. @Gemini
> I can plan daily tasks, but when the time comes, I always procrastinate.
> Please act as an educator and psychologist, and help me design an actionable set of psychological and behavioral mini-rituals and processes for when tasks arise, to prevent procrastination and enable task execution. This can include internal suggestions, procedural thinking, etc.


## The Five-Minute Startup Ritual â€” Help You Overcome Procrastination and Take Immediate Action

*Core concept: Don't think about "completing the entire task," just think about "starting painlessly and continuing for 5 minutes."*

### Step 1: Pause & Acknowledge - About 15 seconds
- **Take five deep breaths.**
- Internal suggestion/thinking: "Feeling irritated, wanting to get distracted, don't want to start."
- **Accept the current resistance, observe current emotions, practice mindful positive thinking.**

### Step 2: Quickly Reaffirm a "Small" Meaning - About 30 seconds
**By doing this task for 5 minutes, I can experience XX, it's worth starting the journey.**

### Step 3: Define the "Micro" Starting Action - About 15 seconds
- "Just open that Word document."
- "Just put on shoes to go out."

### Step 4: Commit to a "Just 5 Minutes" Experience - About 10 seconds
**Just 5 minutes, set a 5-minute countdown.**

### Step 5: Execute the Starting Action & Ritualize the Transition - Action!
Start the countdown, **rub your hands together**.

> **Note: Don't blame yourself even if the ritual fails.**
