Day-to-day mundane experiences rarely create deep mutual memories.

New experiences, new feelings, profound experiences, and deep emotions are what build lasting memories in our hearts and demonstrate that we care. This, in turn, shows my caring.

Therefore, if I care about and love someone, I should strive to create new experiences together, building profound memories that belong to us both.
