My entertainment choices are barren, bringing neither lasting satisfaction nor anything more than fleeting pleasure.

Planning and exploring new forms of entertainment has become imperative.

First, we must explore entertainment options that offer experiential value. New, unexperienced activities are sure to bring a sense of fulfillment.

Second, we need to reasonably control our entertainment methods, seeking enjoyment only in valuable recreational activities. We should avoid excessive indulgence in watching live streams, scrolling through information feeds, and watching videos. Instead, we should invest time in more meaningful activities such as reading, exercise, socializing, and knowledge sharing.

Exploring the multiple dimensions of oneself and experiencing new things is absolutely the most enjoyable experience right now. Rather than being confined to introspection, it's better to expand and experience the external world while maintaining self-reflection.
