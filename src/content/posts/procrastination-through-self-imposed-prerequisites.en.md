Like many initiatives, I always set limits for myself, shackling myself with layers of constraints: In my perception, I believe I must first understand cross-border e-commerce before I can start looking for related jobs, I must master video storytelling before I can start creating YouTube content, I must achieve something before I can offer advice, and I must have a stable financial foundation before I dare to pursue life experiences, social connections, and emotional bonds. These self-imposed thresholds are, in reality, high walls I've built for myself.

I always set prerequisites for my goals, hoping to be prepared when facing new things, to have a buffer for fear. However, this mindset makes me see change as a shock rather than a life experience. I always think that life is about seeking different experiences and encountering different dimensions of myself. But I still fear new experiences that might bring embarrassment and discomfort.

Awkward situations are actually nothing to worry about. Whether it's an imagined destination, the sense of relief afterward, or viewed in the long river of life, these discomforts are merely fleeting moments. Besides, when I currently have nothing, the awkward situations encountered on the path of adventure are both inevitable and a test before achieving results.

Prior learning and understanding are not prerequisites or buffers for action. When actively or passively changing, there's no need for much preparation or buffering.
