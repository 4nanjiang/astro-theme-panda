I watched "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" series about 10 years ago.

During my chunnibyou phase, I was drawn to kuudere characters. I remember always declaring my fondness for Yuki Nagato in discussions. The reasons for liking Yuki Nagato were twofold: first, she seemed omniscient, and second, she maintained her quiet demeanor even while silently contributing from the shadowsâ€”a selfless personality.

However, as my memories of the series gradually fade, it's ironically Haruhi Suzumiya who leaves the strongest impression now.

> If any of you are aliens, time travelers, people from other dimensions, or espers, come find me. That is all!

As I grow older, I increasingly want to surround myself with interesting things. I want to maintain a heart that seeks out the interesting, and become an interesting person myself.

How do we define ourselves, and by what measures do we make our choices? "Being interesting" must be one of those measures.

**Interesting!**
