The value of a routine lies in its ability to establish fixed time planning throughout the day. Through the use of established patterns, we can organically divide our time, creating a familiar framework for daily activities.

Time is equal for everyone, and each moment of time is equally valuable. The value of my ideal routine is primarily reflected in the following aspects:

First, as the saying goes, "The morning hour has gold in its mouth," a good start and planning is my primary expectation for a routine. I hope the routine can create a framework for a fulfilling day, making it easier to fill in life's affairs. When facing life's uncertainties, I hope to pre-construct a shaped container.

Second, **a routine is like a carefully constructed container that will hold both our known and unknown daily life**. Therefore, I aim to build a container that is both robust and personalized.

Furthermore, this container should reflect my appreciation and utilization of time, showcase behaviors I believe are worth maintaining long-term, and reflect my focus on real life. By constructing our ideal current state, we can better face the future.

As a daily time framework, routine must have temporality and requires planning specific daily task timepoints:
- Morning ritual
- Midday reading
- Evening chilling

To reflect current priorities, routine should include the following elements:

1. Healthy Living
   - Fixed time slots for exercise and fitness
   - Maintain early sleeping and rising, making full use of the day

2. Self-improvement
   - Reflection through morning journaling
   - Track personal roadmap progress
   - Cultivate self-aware habits, consciously monitor attention

3. Life Experience
   - **Emphasize attention to emotions and mood**
   - Focus on advancing core roadmap tasks
   - Set daily task reward mechanisms, ensuring rewards bring fulfilling experiences and beautiful memories

4. Financial Management
   - Daily accounting habits
   - Regular budget and expense review
   - Monitor piggy bank regular deposits
   - Track financial goal completion and deadlines
