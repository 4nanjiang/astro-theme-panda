What am I thinking at the moment I decide to procrastinate? At that moment, I'm thinking that I'll eventually complete it anyway.

I've mentally accepted as fact that my future self will definitely take action and be able to complete the task. So, even if I procrastinate now, my future self will make up for it sooner or later. Right now I can enjoy myself, and my future self has the ability to complete the task, perhaps even doing it better.

There's a strange confidence that comes from nowhere. On one hand, I believe my future self will complete it anyway, so why rush now? On the other hand, I believe I have the ability to handle the tasks in my plan. Therefore, I consistently substitute execution with procrastination.

**What I'm thinking is: I'll have to do it sooner or later, so there's no rush right now; I assume I can complete it, confident in my ability.**

My subconscious thought patterns have solidified into inertia, promoting procrastination as a habit of thinking. This mindset leads me to procrastinate on everything.

Perhaps the correct thinking should be:
- Humbly ask myself, can I really handle this? Imagine tasks and matters as challenges, approach them with humility, like an underdog facing a stronger opponent. Adopt a gaming mindset and, during decision-making, recall the **independence and freedom** in my Roadmap, taking on the task as the protagonist.
- Since **I'll have to do it sooner or later, I might as well do it now and enjoy later**. If it's necessary, do it now and leave leisure and entertainment for my future self. This is also the concept of financial freedom: earn money when young, be free when older.
