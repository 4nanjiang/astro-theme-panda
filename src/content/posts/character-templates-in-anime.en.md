While casually watching the April anime releases, I experienced a contradictory feeling: these works, though unremarkable, somehow feel oddly comfortable. Even with the most ordinary worldview and plot settings, they maintain their unique rhythm.

The reason might lie in the mature industrialized production system of the anime industry, which can consistently create above-average character portrayals through standardized creative processes and fixed character templates.

In this era of industrialized content consumption, audiences tend to form emotional connections with characters more easily, while their attention to the plot itself relatively decreases.

This serves as both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that characters are well-crafted and emotionally resonant, with typical character templates making it easier to achieve audience empathy at a low cost. The disadvantage is that these fixed character templates lack depth.
