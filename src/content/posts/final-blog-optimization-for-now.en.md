Today, I made several modifications to my blog:
- Optimized the blog's SEO by generating meta tags through frontmatter.
- Added partytown integration for Google Analytics.
- Implemented accessibility improvements.
- Added site information in the footer.

During these modifications, I realized that such optimization work is endless, and I should focus more on writing blog content.
