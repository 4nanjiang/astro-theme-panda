**The secret to waking up early is: going to bed earlier, preparing for sleep earlier, and falling asleep earlier.**

Why do I always think about procrastinating? This is about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, after all, avoiding inner challenges is the most comfortable. The most difficult thing is always going against the current, and those long-delayed tasks are generally the most necessary ones. Procrastinated tasks are the biggest enemies of execution satisfaction and improvement. When looking at a schedule full of procrastinated tasks, one cannot get the satisfaction and feedback from completing them. **To improve execution ability, the primary task is to resolve all procrastinated items, so that you can obtain the satisfying feedback of completion, and then create a positive cycle.**

**Any preparation should first meet usability. So-called perfection comes step by step through implementation and feedback.**
