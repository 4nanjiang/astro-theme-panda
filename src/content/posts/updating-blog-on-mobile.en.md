Yesterday's blog post was written and published on my phone.

While writing on mobile isn't particularly difficult, the challenge lies in composing the YAML front matter and publishing to GitHub. On desktop, AI in VS Code automatically generates tags, descriptions, and filenames in the YAML, which can then be pushed to GitHub. On mobile, this becomes an inefficient manual process, and while AI assistance is available, it requires switching between apps for editing.

Editing text with AI assistance in VS Code on desktop has become a pleasure. The mobile experience, however, remains cumbersome and less efficient.
