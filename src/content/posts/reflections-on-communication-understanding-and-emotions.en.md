This morning, I watched the White House press conference between Trump and Zelenskyy, along with the conflicting opinions in the comments. I tried to approach it with an observational mindset, reflecting on communication and dialogue.

The process of communication is about choices, not right or wrong. In any exchange, no party has the authority to pronounce judgment on justice or morality. While this may involve personal beliefs and ideals, from an economic perspective, it's also a transaction - how communication can foster understanding and reach solutions.

In observing dialogue, first identify the information. Information accuracy is crucial yet challenging. Additionally, distinguish between facts and personal opinions in others' expressions. Consider from which perspective facts are observed and their agenda setting. To overcome emotional reactions to opinions, understand that there will always be views you agree and disagree with. Overcome your emotions by embracing freedom of thought and expression. Regardless of background, everyone has the right to express themselves, so you must acknowledge others' freedom to express their views. Even if you disagree with an opinion, respect the fact that independent individuals have the freedom to think and express themselves. Respecting human freedom is a prerequisite for communication, a principle worth remembering always.

When reading others' viewpoints, free yourself from emotional influences under the principles of free expression and thought. Next, analyze the context and background of others' perspectives. Words are incomplete; opinions always have context. Even emotionally driven views have underlying logic. Observe and consider the context, trying to understand the underlying logic. Practice communication more, conduct background research beforehand. Importantly, keep asking questions until you understand the logic behind others' views, their background, and context.

Then, begin analyzing viewpoints and consider how to respond. Following others' logic, humbly express your understanding of their views, adding context to help them understand your logic.

However, communication and expression aren't solely about facts, opinions, and logic. In fact, these comprise only a small part, with more information hidden in expressions, gestures, and etiquette.

Understanding emotions is equally important, as humans are emotional beings. Emotions form the foundation for communicating facts and opinions. Taking care of emotions is more important than attending to facts.
