Last night, I went out for a ride on my electric scooter and observed several nearby night markets.

One of them was a night market converted from a bus station, with a middle school a hundred meters away. Unfortunately, it's summer vacation now, so only five or six people passed by in ten minutes—very deserted.

The busiest place was the public sports square. There was a soccer field, with a few people squeezed at both ends playing around the goalposts, most people playing badminton, and parents warming up with their children, playing and exercising. The crowded crowd silently divided their own spaces. Several basketball courts were filled with middle and high school students sweating it out. Outside, the public fitness equipment was also packed with children and parents. Around the area was a running track, where middle-aged people walked briskly counterclockwise, moving forward together in a congested flow, like a swirling stream.

Despite the large crowd, there were surprisingly few stalls. Only a handful of vendors sold ice water and toys, with just one selling baked pancakes. I think the crowd consisted mainly of local residents—parents with children and middle-aged or elderly people—coming to exercise after dinner. Although it seemed lively, the group was actually quite fixed.

There was almost no demand for food, as everyone had already eaten and came out to exercise. Living nearby, exercising for half an hour, there was no real need to buy water on the spot. There were many children, so it seemed like there was a market for toys, but the money was all controlled by the parents.

Around 8:30, I arrived at a park 2-3 kilometers away. Most people had already left. In the park square, a few food vendors sat behind their stalls playing on their phones, with no business. The only activity left was a ring-toss game for toys, but at this hour, most children had been told to go home and sleep.

I finished watching the latest adaptation of "The Count of Monte Cristo." The film made many changes from the original novel, weakening the portrayal of the Count and several other characters. The rushed runtime left no room to develop their personalities. However, I liked the performances, sets, and music. As for Haydée's story, compared to the original, I found it more romantic and vivid.

I also watched the beginning of "Fire of Love." With the outbreak of the Vietnam War and disappointment in human society, the volcano couple turned to volcanoes for solace. There's a line at the start of the film: volcanoes are greater than humans.

Whether from a historical perspective or a cosmic one, perhaps by stepping back we find the essence and reality, or maybe we are just seeking some kind of solace. I don't know.
