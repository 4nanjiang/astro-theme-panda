Speaking of listening to audiobooks before sleep, it's actually a great routine.

It allows my eyes to rest earlier.

In the past, I would plan to sleep after 11 PM, sometimes even at 11:30 PM. Then I would turn off the lights, close my eyes, open the app to listen to audiobooks, using them as a sleep aid. If I want to listen to more books, read more, I could actually lie down earlier. Otherwise, like now when I listen every night, I might fall asleep within 10 minutes, barely hearing much of the story.

I can **lie down earlier to listen to audiobooks**. First, this allows for longer listening time; second, if I still fall asleep early, it adds to my sleep duration, enabling me to wake up earlier and more comfortably the next morning - achieving two benefits at once.
