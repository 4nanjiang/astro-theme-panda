The plot and character development feel incomplete. My expectations were too high, which led to disappointment with the animation.

## Evening Reflections

The traditional New Year's Eve dinner seems different this year. Perhaps it's not the food that's changed, but rather our perceptions and expectations. The familiar sounds of the Spring Festival Gala in the background, the scent of home-cooked dishes, and the warmth of family gatherings all carry different meanings as we grow older.
