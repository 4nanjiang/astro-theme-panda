When researching personal financial management knowledge, I found an emphasis on distinguishing between necessary and desired expenditures.

This reminds me of the four-quadrant task management method, which differentiates between important and unimportant tasks. The economic approach sounds more reasonable. "Unimportant" implies that something still has some importance, just not as much. Whereas "desire" is about wants - it seems important but is actually an impulse. Rather than delaying unimportant tasks, it's better to clarify whether they belong to the "desire" category.

After careful consideration, I've organized my personal Roadmap, which is necessary. Presenting it as an aesthetically pleasing flowchart on my blog, however, is merely a desire. Wasting time on things we desire, satisfying those wants while delaying necessary tasks, is irrational.
