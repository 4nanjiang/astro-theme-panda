Currently, I'm trying to write blogs consistently, committing to daily updates. Based on the experiences of those before me, I have some personal insights.

The content of daily blogs relies on **daily** information acquisition. Is the sustainability of blogging related to the accumulation of topics? I believe it is, but minimally. First, it's difficult to find inspiration from accumulated stockpiled topics. Without recording the context of a topic at the time, it's hard to recall previous thoughts and ideas when writing. Second, accumulated topics will eventually be exhausted, and daily blogging tends to become impulsive writing of the moment, thus making writing a tool for thinking.

Writing blogs doesn't necessarily promote information absorption in return. Acquiring effective information is a habit. But if you don't already have a reading habit, don't expect writing to encourage reading. This is reversing cause and effect.

Writing blogs does promote thinking.
- When you want to discuss a certain topic, it makes you think about the topic itself.
- When you have few topics to choose from but must write something, blogging becomes like an assigned essay topic. You may have rarely thought about this topic before, but writing makes you search and hypothesize logic within your existing mental framework.
