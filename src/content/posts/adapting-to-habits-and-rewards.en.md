During the Spring Festival, I lost most of my habits in Habitica. What's most regrettable is losing the sense of that cycle just as I was beginning to adapt to the rhythm of task completion and rewards.

Since incorporating the concept of rewards, entertainment activities like gaming have become more precious life pleasures. Because they're earned through effort, I can enjoy them with a clear conscience and appreciate them more deeply. Moreover, while becoming more valuable, leisure entertainment has also become more moderate.

Habits and rewards - aren't they a form of compound interest cycle in life?
