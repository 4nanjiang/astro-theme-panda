With so many task management and habit apps available, why did I choose Habitica? Gamification is certainly one reason, but more importantly, it's the only one that incorporates rewards.

Incentives are the source of motivation. Tasks may remain incomplete due to laziness, environmental choices, decision-making and emotional habits, or perhaps a lack of good incentives.

How to create effective incentives?
- SMART small goals with short cycles
- Tangible rewards that you can physically touch
- Activity rewards, like hiking or visiting a park
- Achievement rewards with visualization, playing music to enhance the sense of accomplishment
- Shareable, social rewards
- Reviewing small achievements, engaging in positive self-dialogue, praising yourself
- Focusing on rewarding the process rather than the perfection of results
