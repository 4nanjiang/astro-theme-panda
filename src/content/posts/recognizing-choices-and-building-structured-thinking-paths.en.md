When facing choices, I often fail to recognize that a choice lies before me, even when multiple options are available.

Unable to see the approaching choices or perceive different paths, rationality fails to enter my thinking process.

Even when I do become aware, without a familiar psychological pathway for making choices, my decisions end up being driven by temptation and emotions.

I should not only train my awareness of choices and attention but also design a logical thinking framework to confront these choices.
