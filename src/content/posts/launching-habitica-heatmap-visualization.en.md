Yesterday, I launched the [habitica heatmap](https://routine.nanjiang.online/) webpage, which visualizes Habitica's Dailies data in a heatmap format.
However, the interface design is quite unappealing. After considering the web redesign, I concluded that a single-column vertical layout would be the best approach.

Therefore, the following aspects need to be redesigned:
- [ ] Element layout
- [ ] Color differentiation
- [ ] Data analysis positioning
