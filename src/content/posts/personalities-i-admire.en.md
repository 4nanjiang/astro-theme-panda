I came across a phrase: "great personality."

I admire people with straightforward personalities, those with vibrant and energetic spirits, and those who maintain a calm demeanor while having a witty sense of humor. However, I dislike my own personality of hiding in dark corners, like a rat lurking in the sewers, peering out at the world.

I need to encourage myself more. Keep going!
