- Don't overly focus on or worry about the macroeconomic social environment and industry development. Times are changing, new professions are born in new environments, and the skills required for jobs are also changing. Changes in the era inevitably bring new ways to play.
- As an ordinary person, you cannot grasp the direction of the times. Therefore, don't focus on the future prospects or salaries of industries or positions. Choose a direction that interests you, a job that aligns with an experiential lifestyle.
- A career is not a one-way long pipeline, but a network connection of dots. You must first stand on one dot, in this field, from your starting point to where you achieve stellar accomplishments. Accelerate mastering the ways of this field's dot, and persist in accumulating time.
- You can only see the next dot in the latter half of the journey. So, don't hesitate because you can't see the future now.
- When moving from one dot to the next, what needs to be ensured is: elevating your starting point for the next journey sufficiently high. This can be accumulated skills, experience, or connections and resources.
- You may not be Elon Musk, but think about Elon Musk. Each time he started, he completely abandoned his previous field.
- The world is often a makeshift stage; even incompetent people can become leaders. Don't be afraid due to lack of experience. Are you not better than an incompetent person?! What you lack is only the perseverance and courage to wait for opportunities.
