After the typhoon passed, there’s a daily spell of showers and the weather is getting cooler. Last night, I slept with the window open, lying on a bamboo mat, enjoying the night breeze.

Yesterday, I confirmed an interview for next Wednesday, and felt an urge to go to another city. Afterwards, I even checked the city’s geography, looked up rental prices for nearby houses, and imagined different ways of living.

In the morning, I used Grok and Gemini to organize a set of self-training materials—over twenty pages—hoping to become familiar with a new field.

The first step is to become a part of something; the second step is to become an indispensable component; the third step is to create, rather than just be a part.

Live your own life—whether lost or idling—you can still eat many more curries.

Don’t forget to breathe!
