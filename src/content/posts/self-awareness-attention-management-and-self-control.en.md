I repeatedly emphasize 'Self-awareness' internally, which refers to being conscious of the present moment, continuously being aware of one's internal states (such as thoughts and emotions), behaviors, environment, and various choices being made.

Recently, I've realized that the core of this awareness ability is the management and guidance of attention. Through mindfulness methods, we temporarily step away from purely subjective immersive experiences to examine our current state, situation, and behavioral choices from a more objective or observer's perspective.

Looking at the results, this awareness is about improving attention management and guidance. Essentially, it forms the foundation and manifestation of self-control.

Of course, there needs to be a transformation of executive function between recognizing the need to manage attention and adjust behavior, and actually demonstrating effective self-control. However, when we can objectively notice our attention and consciously analyze our emotional and behavioral patterns, we can learn and apply thinking models and behavioral strategies to gradually develop self-control abilities.
