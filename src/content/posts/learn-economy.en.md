Today, I stumbled upon an introductory economics book titled "Talking to My Daughter about the Economy." It came recommended by a content creator, so I decided to give it a read.

I've just finished the first chapter, which draws its narrative perspective from "Guns, Germs, and Steel," explaining the origins of inequality.

I took a moment to reflect on why I've always wanted to study economics. First, I want to understand the world more logically and satisfy my curiosity. Second, I've always believed that understanding economics is a sufficient condition for making money.

However, upon closer reflection, it's not that my cognitive abilities can't keep up with the ability to make money. I simply lack the courage to make mistakes - I've always hesitated to take that first step.
