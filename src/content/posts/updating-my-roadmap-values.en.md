After exploring various tools, I ultimately chose to use Excalidraw within Logseq to create a simple diagram of my personal roadmap.

It consists of 3 core values:
- Wealth: Ensuring independence and pursuing freedom
- Self-awareness: Being self-aware and living in the present
- Encounter: Experiencing different dimensions of oneself
