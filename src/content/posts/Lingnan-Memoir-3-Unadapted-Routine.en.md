Recently, I have been feeling extremely tired at night.

After coming to a new city and living in an unfamiliar environment, my daily rhythm has changed. The inertia of my body and senses cannot keep up with the changes in time. My life has lost its routine.

I get home a little after six and curl up in my cramped rental room. While scrolling on my phone, I subconsciously try to catch my breath from the sudden changes in life. The fan I bought arrived, and I assembled it. Unknowingly, it was already past eight o’clock. I had no choice but to go out to find something to eat.

I went to a mall a few hundred meters away and walked around it clockwise. At the entrance, a few people were looking at the shop rental prices posted on the wall. In the central plaza, there were standees for the game "Love and Deep Space." The mall is smaller than the one a kilometer away, but it feels more unique. Also, people who like to stroll around the deli section of the supermarket seem to connect with the food and the crowd at night.

By the time I got back, it was already half past nine. I rested for a while and took a shower. After browsing Bilibili for a bit, I made up my mind to write this blog post. Unknowingly, it’s already this late.
